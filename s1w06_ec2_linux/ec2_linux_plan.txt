KEY QUESTION:
In a data centre environment:
| We have to plug in connectivity to different
servers.
| Also, we have control over what gets plugged into what.
| The network tends to reflect the physical infrastructure to a
degree.
| A geographically distributed system will also use WAN (internet)
links and/or VPNs, dedicated circuits etc.
| Often will have largely separate systems under our control.
How does this happen within the cloud?

VPC is a "Virtual Private Cloud"
| Actually a software-defined network.
| Having virtual private clouds is what differentiates the likes of
Azure and AWS from the virtual server providers.
| Just like in a DC environment, we could have a cloud network that is
wholly/partially isolated from the internet at large.
| Can have multiple VPCs associated with a single AWS account
(e.g. one per project/customer).

Idea is that you can create your own network across the availability
zones within a region:
| The VPC is how infrastructure services are arranged, connected
together and to the internet and distributed amongst data centres.
| Numbering scheme etc. 
| VPC: spans ALL AZs within a region.
| SUBNET: associated with a single AZ (cannot span more than that)

Each instance has a "Network Interface".

Internet gateway 
NAT gateway (IPV4)
Egress only (IPV6)

SECURITY:
| Security groups: firewall for EC2 instances
| Network ACL.

Problem as set.
